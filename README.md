# HandM
I will be uploading exploratory data analysis notebooks on the HandM products data, taken from Kaggle

Data link - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/niharpatel03/h-and-m-product-dataset/data

This dataset contains a rich and structured catalog of H&M products scraped directly from their official website. It includes detailed metadata for each product such as:

- Product ID, Name, and Brand
- Product URL and Price
- Stock Availability and Coming Soon Flag
- Color Name, Available Color Variants, and Color Shades
- New Arrival Flag and Main Category Code
- Detailed Product Descriptions
- Comprehensive Material Composition Information, including sustainability indicators like recycled cotton and recycled thermoplastic rubber.
